# Project 1

A data visualization of seed data provided by the UCI Machine Learning Respository. 

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds

This is a collaboration between Quyen Ha and Marty Dang for CSCI 3665: From Data to Visualization. 
It was made primarily with javascript and D3.

BarGraph.js is the external javascript file that draws an interactive bar chart that 
graphs the seeds' id number on the y axis and the seeds'area on the x axis. 

ScatterPlot.js is the external javascript file that draws an interactive scatter plot 
that two drop-down menus to change the data displayed on the x and y axis. 

Project1.css is the external css file that determines how HTML elements will display
on screen. 

Project1.html is the main HTML file that will call all the javascript and css files. 

RoseArea.csv is a csv file with only the Rose type seeds in them. The bar graph displays it

seeds.csv is the csv file with all the types of seed. It is the original data (minus some corrupt points)
that we used in our scater plot.

To run: Open the Project1.html file in a FireFox and enjoy!
